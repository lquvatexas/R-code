#  Graph a function whose formula you know
#  This is a pretty simple example

#  Define the function we want to graph.  
#  Give it a name.  Here I choose the name graphfunction.

	graphfunction=function(x){
		result=x^2
		return(result)}

#  Define the domain over which we will graph it.  
#  Here I use the seq command with the endpoints and number of points in between.	

	x=seq(-6,6,len=120)

#  Start the process of computing the value of the function for each of the 
#  values in the domain I will use.	

	ini=rep(0,120)
	n=length(ini)

#  Now make the loop to define the vector of f(x) values

	for (i in 1:n){
	ini[i]=graphfunction(x[i])
	}

#  Now I have a vector of domain values called x and a vector of range values
#  called ini.   So I call that vector of range values  the result.		

	result=ini

#  Here I make a graph of the range values versus the domain values.   
#  The third parameter says to draw a line between the points.  	

	plot(x,result,type="l",xlab="x",ylab="f(x)")

#  Here's the pdf for Chapter 1, problem 47c.  

#  Define the function we want to graph.  
#  Give it a name.  Here I choose the name graphfunction.

	graphfunction=function(x){
		result=(exp(-x)) * (exp(-(exp(-x))))
		return(result)}

#  Define the domain over which we will graph it.  
#  Here I use the seq command with the endpoints and number of points in between.	

	x=seq(-20,20,len=400)

#  Start the process of computing the value of the function for each of the 
#  values in the domain I will use.	

	ini=rep(0,400)
	n=length(ini)

#  Now make the loop to define the vector of f(x) values
