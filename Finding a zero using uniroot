#finding a zero for x^3+3x+1 using uniroot
#before beginning, one must determine an interval such that f(y) 
# has opposite signs at the endpoints
# when looking at the graph we saw that only one root exists, 
# thus we can use a very wide interval making sure the root is in 
#  between the endpoints

	graphfunction=function(x){
		(x^3)+(3*x)+1
		}
	x=seq(-5,5,len=100)
	ini=rep(0,100)
	n=length(ini)
	for (i in 1:n){
		ini[i]=graphfunction(x[i])
		}
	result=ini
	plot(x,result,type="l",xlab="x",ylab="f(x)")

	out=uniroot(function(x){
		(x^3)+(3*x)+1},
		lower=-100, upper=100, tol=0.0001)
	out

#another way to write finding a zero for x^3+3x+1 using uniroot
#  This assumes that we already used the graph to find an interval.
#  Here I'm just illustrating that you can split the algebraic expression 
#  of the function into pieces in the definition of the function
#   This will make it easier to work with complicated functions.  

	out=uniroot(function(x){
		part1=x^3
		part2=(3*x)+1
		all=part1+part2
		return(all)},
		lower=-100, upper=100, tol=0.0001)
	unlist(out)

# the unlist command just lists the whole thing in one row.
